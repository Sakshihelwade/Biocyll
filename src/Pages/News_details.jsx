                                <p>Protecting public officials from safety threats is important. But the answer isnâ€™t to restrict truthful reporting. Kratovilâ€™s dispute with Caputo shows exactly why government secrecy laws are a bad idea.

                                    When we give officials the power to tell journalists what they can and canâ€™t print, even in the name of privacy, officials inevitably try to stop reporting that they find embarrassing or inconvenient. Thatâ€™s pcisely what happened in this case.

                                    When Kratovil first reached out to Caputo to ask if he lived in New Brunswick, the police department responded that his place of residence couldnâ€™t be released under Danielâ€™s Law. Caputo then sent his cease-and-desist letter after Kratovil, at a city council meeting, said the street name where Caputo lived in Cape May, not his exact address.

                                    Using a broad interpretation of Danielâ€™s Law, Caputo tried to bully Kratovil from reporting that he lived too far away to regularly attend city meetings. Caputo and the city didnâ€™t change their tune until they were sued and it became clear how bad it would look to argue that a reporter canâ€™t even name the city where the director of police lives.

                                    But other journalists might not have the resources to fight back like Kratovil did. New Jersey officials who want to kill a news story raising questions about where they live, questionable real estate deals, or potential conflicts of interest can use Danielâ€™s Law to threaten reporters with fines or even jail time every time they want a news story killed.</p>

              <p> Mass production of a naturally-derived living micro-organism of bio inoculants with high potency, high density, reliability, and consistent efficacy is a difficult task. We have mastered the art and product technology through Whole-cell mass multiplication of bio inoculants.
                CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT
                All commercialized products are also regularly revalidated for virulence and efficacy at least once a year by rotation to ensure sustained quality. In addition, these products are also under continuous improvement programs to increase effectiveness, shelf life, stress tolerance, and other parameters. Owing to these rigorous measures, IPL Biologicals products are continuously improving in quality and efficacy year-on-year.
                HUMAN RESOURCES
                The strong TIC team is backed by expertise from allied fields, i.e. Microbiology, Nematology, Agronomy, Entomology, Pathology, Molecular biology, Industrial Microbiology, Biochemistry, Whole-cell mass multiplication Technology, and Applied Science to ensure an integrated approach to new product development.</p>
